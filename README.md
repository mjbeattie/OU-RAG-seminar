This repository contains scripts that can be used as starting points for Retrieval Augmented Generation projects.  There are two basic scripts:
* __opensource-rag-example.ipynb__: Upload this script to Google Colab, attach it to a GPU runtime, and you should be able to execute it as-is
* __openai-rag-example.ipynb__:  This file is an example of how to use production resources in an industry environment.  You will need to have an Azure subscription with Cognitive Search and Azure OpenAI to use it.
* __openai-contract-summarizer.ipynb__:  Another example that uses production resources.  This script uses prompt engineering to pass a PDF of a contract to OpenAI in order to explore it.
